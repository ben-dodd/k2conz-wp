If it is not reasonably practicable to eliminate exposure to airborne asbestos, exposure must be minimised so far as is reasonably practicable.

Regulation 9(2) of the Asbestos Regulations requires PCBUs with management or control of a workplace to ensure that the airborne contamination standard for asbestos is not exceeded at the workplace (however, in relation to an  asbestos removal area where class A asbestos removal work is being carried out, the regulations impose a more stringent standard). These requirements work together to ensure that there is a limit to the amount of asbestos that is permitted in the air of a workplace, without implying or meaning that the level delineates what is acceptable for personal exposure. Personal exposure must be eliminated or minimised so far as is reasonably practicable. The  WES provided within this guide for asbestos must be applied accordingly."
